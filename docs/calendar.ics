SUMMARY:Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream
DESCRIPTION:The process is simple: we put cream in a bowl\, add the ingredients\, and the blast it with liquid nitrogen. Beautiful clouds of vapor billow from the bowl\, roll across the table and cascade over the edge. The liquid nitrogen freezes it so fast that the ice crystals dont get a chance to grow and the resulting ice cream is the smoothest\, creamiest and freshest youll ever experience. It is amazing to watch and tastes incredible. Private Island Ice Cream isnt just ice cream\, its ice cream with a show!

SUMMARY:Joe's Spray Can Art
DESCRIPTION:An artist (Or multiple) will set up and put on a show of the unique art style called Spray Can Art. They will produce 57 paintings at the rate of one painting every 3 to 5 minutes. Done on poster board with a spray can\, the artist uses a strange array of tools to manipulate the paint. Its a show in itself! Joe is an accomplished New York City street artist who was struck by lightning while standing on his apartment roof. He taught himself to paint while recovering\, and when he conquered the streets of NYC\, he moved to Florida where he teamed up with three other artists who each have their own unique artistic style. Joe and his trained artists are awesome to work with\, they put on a great show\, and at the end your students have a lifetime memento.

SUMMARY:Lunch and Learn | Collaborative Online International Learning VE & Study Abroad (Branded Programs vs Faculty Led Programs)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by: Rosemarie Igbo\, Dr. Barbara MacLennan\, and Dr. Maria Agee Join the Office of Global Engagement to learn more about Study Abroad and Virtual Exchange. Unfamiliar with the topic? No worries! Here's a little crash course: Branded Programs-faculty decide the best semester for their students to study abroad on the program and pre-approve a set of courses for students to take. This creates a clear pathway toward graduation that includes study abroad and aligns with the goals of the academic unit. Faculty Led Programs - Customized programs that meet a specific objective. A professor travels with a group of students and either teaches a course or oversees a project or internship. COIL VE - Virtual Exchange (VE) or Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) is an innovative pedagogy that allows professors and students to use technology to engage with their peers at universities around the globe.
